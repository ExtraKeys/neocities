<h1 id="developing-themes">Developing Themes</h1>
<p>A guide to creating and distributing custom themes.</p>
<hr />
<p>!!! Note</p>
<pre><code>If you are looking for existing third party themes, they are listed in the
MkDocs [community wiki]. If you want to share a theme you create, you
should list it on the Wiki.
</code></pre>
<p>When creating a new theme, you can either follow the steps in this guide to
create one from scratch or you can download the <code>mkdocs-basic-theme</code> as a
basic, yet complete, theme with all the boilerplate required. <strong>You can find
this base theme on <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-basic-theme">GitHub</a></strong>. It contains detailed comments in
the code to describe the different features and their usage.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-custom-theme">Creating a custom theme</h2>
<p>The bare minimum required for a custom theme is a <code>main.html</code> <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">Jinja2
template</a> file which is placed in a directory that is <em>not</em> a child of the
<a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#docs_dir">docs_dir</a>. Within <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, set the <a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#custom_dir"><code>theme.custom_dir</code></a>
option to the path of the directory containing <code>main.html</code>. The path should be
relative to the configuration file. For example, given this example project
layout:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">mkdocs.yml
docs/
    index.md
    about.md
custom_theme/
    main.html
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>&hellip; you would include the following settings in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> to use the custom theme
directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">theme:
    name: null
    custom_dir: 'custom_theme/'
</code></pre>
<p>!!! Note</p>
<pre><code>Generally, when building your own custom theme, the theme.[name]
configuration setting would be set to `null`. However, if the
theme.[custom_dir] configuration value is used in combination with an
existing theme, the theme.[custom_dir] can be used to replace only specific
parts of a built-in theme. For example, with the above layout and if you set
`name: "mkdocs"` then the `main.html` file in the theme.[custom_dir] would
replace the file of the same name in the `mkdocs` theme but otherwise the
`mkdocs` theme would remain unchanged. This is useful if you want to make
small adjustments to an existing theme.

For more specific information, see [Customizing Your Theme].
</code></pre>
<p>!!! Warning</p>
<pre><code>A theme's [configuration] defined in a `mkdocs_theme.yml` file is not loaded
from `theme.custom_dir`. When an entire theme exists in `theme.custom_dir`
and `theme.name` is set to `null`, then the entire theme configuration must
be defined in the [theme] configuration option in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

However, when a theme is [packaged] up for distribution, and loaded using
the `theme.name` configuration option, then a `mkdocs_theme.yml` file
is required for the theme.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="basic-theme">Basic theme</h2>
<p>The simplest <code>main.html</code> file is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ config.site_name }}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    {{ page.content }}
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The body content from each page specified in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> is inserted using the
<code>{{ page.content }}</code> tag. Style-sheets and scripts can be brought into this
theme as with a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be
generated and included automatically, through the <code>nav</code> and <code>toc</code> objects,
respectively. If you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start
with one of the <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs/themes">built-in themes</a> and modify it accordingly.</p>
<p>!!! Note</p>
<pre><code>As MkDocs uses [Jinja] as its template engine, you have access to all the
power of Jinja, including [template inheritance]. You may notice that the
themes included with MkDocs make extensive use of template inheritance and
blocks, allowing users to easily override small bits and pieces of the
templates from the theme [custom_dir]. Therefore, the built-in themes are
implemented in a `base.html` file, which `main.html` extends. Although not
required, third party template authors are encouraged to follow a similar
pattern and may want to define the same [blocks] as are used in the built-in
themes for consistency.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="theme-files">Theme Files</h2>
<p>There are various files which a theme treats special in some way. Any other
files are simply copied from the theme directory to the same path in the
<code>site_dir</code> when the site it built. For example image and CSS files have no
special significance and are copied as-is. Note, however, that if the user
provides a file with the same path in their <code>docs_dir</code>, then the user&rsquo;s file
will replace the theme file.</p>
<h3 id="template-files">Template Files</h3>
<p>Any files with the <code>.html</code> extension are considered to be template files and are
not copied from the theme directory or any subdirectories. Also, any files
listed in <a href="#static_templates">static_templates</a> are treated as templates regardless of their file
extension.</p>
<h3 id="theme-meta-files">Theme Meta Files</h3>
<p>The various files required for packaging a theme are also ignored. Specifically,
the <code>mkdocs_theme.yml</code> configuration file and any Python files.</p>
<h3 id="dot-files">Dot Files</h3>
<p>Theme authors can explicitly force MkDocs to ignore files by starting a file or
directory name with a dot. Any of the following files would be ignored:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">.ignored.txt
.ignored/file.txt
foo/.ignored.txt
foo/.ignored/file.txt
</code></pre>
<h3 id="documentation-files">Documentation Files</h3>
<p>All documentation files are ignored. Specifically, any Markdown files (using any
of the file extensions supported by MKDocs). Additionally, any README files
which may exist in the theme directories are ignored.</p>
<h2 id="template-variables">Template Variables</h2>
<p>Each template in a theme is built with a template context. These are the
variables that are available to themes. The context varies depending on the
template that is being built. At the moment templates are either built with
the global context or with a page specific context. The global context is used
for HTML pages that don&rsquo;t represent an individual Markdown document, for
example a 404.html page or search.html.</p>
<h3 id="global-context">Global Context</h3>
<p>The following variables are available globally on any template.</p>
<h4 id="config">config</h4>
<p>The <code>config</code> variable is an instance of MkDocs&rsquo; config object generated from the
<code>mkdocs.yml</code> config file. While you can use any config option, some commonly
used options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_name">config.site_name</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_url">config.site_url</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_author">config.site_author</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_description">config.site_description</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#locale">config.theme.locale</a> (See also
  <a href="#locale">Theme Configuration</a> below)</li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#extra_javascript">config.extra_javascript</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#extra_css">config.extra_css</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#repo_url">config.repo_url</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#repo_name">config.repo_name</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#copyright">config.copyright</a></li>
<li><a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#google_analytics">config.google_analytics</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nav">nav</h4>
<p>The <code>nav</code> variable is used to create the navigation for the documentation. The
<code>nav</code> object is an iterable of <a href="#navigation-objects">navigation objects</a> as
defined by the <a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#nav">nav</a> configuration setting.</p>
<p>In addition to the iterable of <a href="#navigation-objects">navigation objects</a>, the
<code>nav</code> object contains the following attributes:</p>
<h5 id="navhomepage">nav.homepage</h5>
<p>The <a href="#page">page</a> object for the homepage of the site.</p>
<h5 id="navpages">nav.pages</h5>
<p>A flat list of all <a href="#page">page</a> objects contained in the navigation. This list
is not necessarily a complete list of all site pages as it does not contain
pages which are not included in the navigation. This list does match the list
and order of pages used for all &ldquo;next page&rdquo; and &ldquo;previous page&rdquo; links. For a
list of all pages, use the <a href="#pages">pages</a> template variable.</p>
<h5 id="nav-example">Nav Example</h5>
<p>Following is a basic usage example which outputs the first and second level
navigation as a nested list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% if nav|length&gt;1 %}
    &lt;ul&gt;
    {% for nav_item in nav %}
        {% if nav_item.children %}
            &lt;li&gt;{{ nav_item.title }}
                &lt;ul&gt;
                {% for nav_item in nav_item.children %}
                    &lt;li class=&quot;{% if nav_item.active%}current{% endif %}&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;a href=&quot;{{ nav_item.url|url }}&quot;&gt;{{ nav_item.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                {% endfor %}
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        {% else %}
            &lt;li class=&quot;{% if nav_item.active%}current{% endif %}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;{{ nav_item.url|url }}&quot;&gt;{{ nav_item.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="base_url">base_url</h4>
<p>The <code>base_url</code> provides a relative path to the root of the MkDocs project. While
this can be used directly by prepending it to a local relative URL, it is best
to use the <a href="#url">url</a> template filter, which is smarter about how it applies
<code>base_url</code>.</p>
<h4 id="mkdocs_version">mkdocs_version</h4>
<p>Contains the current MkDocs version.</p>
<h4 id="build_date_utc">build_date_utc</h4>
<p>A Python datetime object that represents the date and time the documentation
was built in UTC. This is useful for showing how recently the documentation
was updated.</p>
<h4 id="pages">pages</h4>
<p>A flat list of <code>File</code> objects for <em>all</em> pages in the project. This list can
contain pages not included in the global <a href="#nav">navigation</a> and may not match
the order of pages within that navigation. The <a href="#page">page</a> object for each
<code>File</code> can be accessed from <code>file.page</code>.</p>
<h4 id="page">page</h4>
<p>In templates which are not rendered from a Markdown source file, the <code>page</code>
variable is <code>None</code>. In templates which are rendered from a Markdown source file,
the <code>page</code> variable contains a <code>page</code> object. The same <code>page</code> objects are used
as <code>page</code> <a href="#navigation-objects">navigation objects</a> in the global
<a href="#nav">navigation</a> and in the <a href="#pages">pages</a> template variable.</p>
<p>All <code>page</code> objects contain the following attributes:</p>
<h5 id="pagetitle">page.title</h5>
<p>Contains the Title for the current page.</p>
<h5 id="pagecontent">page.content</h5>
<p>The rendered Markdown as HTML, this is the contents of the documentation.</p>
<h5 id="pagetoc">page.toc</h5>
<p>An iterable object representing the Table of contents for a page. Each item in
the <code>toc</code> is an <code>AnchorLink</code> which contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AnchorLink.title</code>: The text of the item.</li>
<li><code>AnchorLink.url</code>: The hash fragment of a URL pointing to the item.</li>
<li><code>AnchorLink.level</code>: The zero-based level of the item.</li>
<li><code>AnchorLink.children</code>: An iterable of any child items.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example would display the top two levels of the Table of Contents
for a page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;ul&gt;
{% for toc_item in page.toc %}
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ toc_item.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ toc_item.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    {% for toc_item in toc_item.children %}
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ toc_item.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ toc_item.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<h5 id="pagemeta">page.meta</h5>
<p>A mapping of the metadata included at the top of the markdown page. In this
example we define a <code>source</code> property above the page title.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">source: generics.py
        mixins.py

# Page title

Content...
</code></pre>
<p>A template can access this metadata for the page with the <code>meta.source</code>
variable. This could then be used to link to source files related to the
documentation page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% for filename in page.meta.source %}
  &lt;a class=&quot;github&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/.../{{ filename }}&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;{{ filename }}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="pageurl">page.url</h5>
<p>The URL of the page relative to the MkDocs <code>site_dir</code>. It is expected that this
be used with the <a href="#url">url</a> filter to ensure the URL is relative to the current
page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;a href=&quot;{{ page.url|url }}&quot;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<h5 id="pageabs_url">page.abs_url</h5>
<p>The absolute URL of the page from the server root as determined by the value
assigned to the <a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_url">site_url</a> configuration setting. The value includes any
subdirectory included in the <code>site_url</code>, but not the domain. <a href="#base_url">base_url</a> should
not be used with this variable.</p>
<p>For example, if <code>site_url: https://example.com/</code>, then the value of
<code>page.abs_url</code> for the page <code>foo.md</code> would be <code>/foo/</code>. However, if
<code>site_url: https://example.com/bar/</code>, then the value of <code>page.abs_url</code> for the
page <code>foo.md</code> would be <code>/bar/foo/</code>.</p>
<h5 id="pagecanonical_url">page.canonical_url</h5>
<p>The full, canonical URL to the current page as determined by the value assigned
to the <a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_url">site_url</a> configuration setting. The value includes the domain and any
subdirectory included in the <code>site_url</code>. <a href="#base_url">base_url</a> should not be used with this
variable.</p>
<h5 id="pageedit_url">page.edit_url</h5>
<p>The full URL to the source page in the source repository. Typically used to
provide a link to edit the source page. <a href="#base_url">base_url</a> should not be used with this
variable.</p>
<h5 id="pageis_homepage">page.is_homepage</h5>
<p>Evaluates to <code>True</code> for the homepage of the site and <code>False</code> for all other
pages. This can be used in conjunction with other attributes of the <code>page</code>
object to alter the behavior. For example, to display a different title
on the homepage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% if not page.is_homepage %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ site_name }}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="pageprevious_page">page.previous_page</h5>
<p>The page object for the previous page or <code>None</code>. The value will be <code>None</code> if the
current page is the first item in the site navigation or if the current page is
not included in the navigation at all. When the value is a page object, the
usage is the same as for <code>page</code>.</p>
<h5 id="pagenext_page">page.next_page</h5>
<p>The page object for the next page or <code>None</code>. The value will be <code>None</code> if the
current page is the last item in the site navigation or if the current page is
not included in the navigation at all. When the value is a page object, the
usage is the same as for <code>page</code>.</p>
<h5 id="pageparent">page.parent</h5>
<p>The immediate parent of the page in the <a href="#nav">site navigation</a>. <code>None</code> if the
page is at the top level.</p>
<h5 id="pagechildren">page.children</h5>
<p>Pages do not contain children and the attribute is always <code>None</code>.</p>
<h5 id="pageactive">page.active</h5>
<p>When <code>True</code>, indicates that this page is the currently viewed page. Defaults
to <code>False</code>.</p>
<h5 id="pageis_section">page.is_section</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;section&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
page objects.</p>
<h5 id="pageis_page">page.is_page</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;page&rdquo; object. Always <code>True</code> for
page objects.</p>
<h5 id="pageis_link">page.is_link</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;link&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
page objects.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-objects">Navigation Objects</h3>
<p>Navigation objects contained in the <a href="#nav">nav</a> template variable may be one of
<a href="#section">section</a> objects, <a href="#page">page</a> objects, and <a href="#link">link</a> objects.
While section objects may contain nested navigation objects, pages and links do
not.</p>
<p>Page objects are the full page object as used for the current <a href="#page">page</a> with
all of the same attributes available. Section and Link objects contain a subset
of those attributes as defined below:</p>
<h4 id="section">Section</h4>
<p>A <code>section</code> navigation object defines a named section in the navigation and
contains a list of child navigation objects. Note that sections do not contain
URLs and are not links of any kind. However, by default, MkDocs sorts index
pages to the top and the first child might be used as the URL for a section if a
theme chooses to do so.</p>
<p>The following attributes are available on <code>section</code> objects:</p>
<h5 id="sectiontitle">section.title</h5>
<p>The title of the section.</p>
<h5 id="sectionparent">section.parent</h5>
<p>The immediate parent of the section or <code>None</code> if the section is at the top
level.</p>
<h5 id="sectionchildren">section.children</h5>
<p>An iterable of all child navigation objects. Children may include nested
sections, pages and links.</p>
<h5 id="sectionactive">section.active</h5>
<p>When <code>True</code>, indicates that a child page of this section is the current page and
can be used to highlight the section as the currently viewed section. Defaults
to <code>False</code>.</p>
<h5 id="sectionis_section">section.is_section</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;section&rdquo; object. Always <code>True</code> for
section objects.</p>
<h5 id="sectionis_page">section.is_page</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;page&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
section objects.</p>
<h5 id="sectionis_link">section.is_link</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;link&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
section objects.</p>
<h4 id="link">Link</h4>
<p>A <code>link</code> navigation object contains a link which does not point to an internal
MkDocs page. The following attributes are available on <code>link</code> objects:</p>
<h5 id="linktitle">link.title</h5>
<p>The title of the link. This would generally be used as the label of the link.</p>
<h5 id="linkurl">link.url</h5>
<p>The URL that the link points to. The URL should always be an absolute URLs and
should not need to have <code>base_url</code> prepended.</p>
<h5 id="linkparent">link.parent</h5>
<p>The immediate parent of the link. <code>None</code> if the link is at the top level.</p>
<h5 id="linkchildren">link.children</h5>
<p>Links do not contain children and the attribute is always <code>None</code>.</p>
<h5 id="linkactive">link.active</h5>
<p>External links cannot be &ldquo;active&rdquo; and the attribute is always <code>False</code>.</p>
<h5 id="linkis_section">link.is_section</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;section&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
link objects.</p>
<h5 id="linkis_page">link.is_page</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;page&rdquo; object. Always <code>False</code> for
link objects.</p>
<h5 id="linkis_link">link.is_link</h5>
<p>Indicates that the navigation object is a &ldquo;link&rdquo; object. Always <code>True</code> for
link objects.</p>
<h3 id="extra-context">Extra Context</h3>
<p>Additional variables can be passed to the template with the
<a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#extra"><code>extra</code></a> configuration option. This is a
set of key value pairs that can make custom templates far more flexible.</p>
<p>For example, this could be used to include the project version of all pages
and a list of links related to the project. This can be achieved with the
following <code>extra</code> configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">extra:
    version: 0.13.0
    links:
        - https://github.com/mkdocs
        - https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html#mkdocs
        - https://www.mkdocs.org/
</code></pre>
<p>And then displayed with this HTML in the custom theme.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{{ config.extra.version }}

{% if config.extra.links %}
  &lt;ul&gt;
  {% for link in config.extra.links %}
      &lt;li&gt;{{ link }}&lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="template-filters">Template Filters</h2>
<p>In addition to Jinja&rsquo;s default filters, the following custom filters are
available to use in MkDocs templates:</p>
<h3 id="url">url</h3>
<p>Normalizes a URL. Absolute URLs are passed through unaltered. If the URL is
relative and the template context includes a page object, then the URL is
returned relative to the page object. Otherwise, the URL is returned with
<a href="#base_url">base_url</a> prepended.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;a href=&quot;{{ page.url|url }}&quot;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="tojson">tojson</h3>
<p>Safety convert a Python object to a value in a JavaScript script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;script&gt;
    var mkdocs_page_name = {{ page.title|tojson|safe }};
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="search-and-themes">Search and themes</h2>
<p>As of MkDocs version <em>0.17</em> client side search support has been added to MkDocs
via the <code>search</code> plugin. A theme needs to provide a few things for the plugin to
work with the theme.</p>
<p>While the <code>search</code> plugin is activated by default, users can disable the plugin
and themes should account for this. It is recommended that theme templates wrap
search specific markup with a check for the plugin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% if 'search' in config['plugins'] %}
    search stuff here...
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<p>At its most basic functionality, the search plugin will simply provide an index
file which is no more than a JSON file containing the content of all pages.
The theme would need to implement its own search functionality client-side.
However, with a few settings and the necessary templates, the plugin can provide
a complete functioning client-side search tool based on <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">lunr.js</a>.</p>
<p>The following HTML needs to be added to the theme so that the provided
JavaScript is able to properly load the search scripts and make relative links
to the search results from the current page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;script&gt;var base_url = '{{ base_url }}';&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With properly configured settings, the following HTML in a template  will add a
full search implementation to your theme.</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">&lt;h1 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;search.html&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;q&quot; id=&quot;mkdocs-search-query&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; &gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;mkdocs-search-results&quot;&gt;
  Sorry, page not found.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The JavaScript in the plugin works by looking for the specific ID&rsquo;s used in the
above HTML. The form input for the user to type the search query must be
identified with <code>id="mkdocs-search-query"</code> and the div where the results will be
placed must be identified with <code>id="mkdocs-search-results"</code>.</p>
<p>The plugin supports the following options being set in the <a href="#theme-configuration">theme&rsquo;s
configuration file</a>, <code>mkdocs_theme.yml</code>:</p>
<h3 id="include_search_page">include_search_page</h3>
<p>Determines whether the search plugin expects the theme to provide a dedicated
search page via a template located at <code>search/search.html</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>include_search_page</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the search template will be built
and available at <code>search/search.html</code>. This method is used by the <code>readthedocs</code>
theme.</p>
<p>When <code>include_search_page</code> is set to <code>false</code> or not defined, it is expected that
the theme provide some other mechanisms for displaying search results. For
example, the <code>mkdocs</code> theme displays results on any page via a modal.</p>
<h3 id="search_index_only">search_index_only</h3>
<p>Determines whether the search plugin should only generate a search index or a
complete search solution.</p>
<p>When <code>search_index_only</code> is set to <code>false</code>, then the search plugin modifies the
Jinja environment by adding its own <code>templates</code> directory (with a lower
precedence than the theme) and adds its scripts to the <code>extra_javascript</code> config
setting.</p>
<p>When <code>search_index_only</code> is set to <code>true</code> or not defined, the search plugin
makes no modifications to the Jinja environment. A complete solution using the
provided index file is the responsibility of the theme.</p>
<p>The search index is written to a JSON file at <code>search/search_index.json</code> in the
<a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#site_dir">site_dir</a>. The JSON object contained within the file may contain up to three
objects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    config: {...},
    data: [...],
    index: {...}
}
</code></pre>
<p>If present, the <code>config</code> object contains the key/value pairs of config options
defined for the plugin in the user&rsquo;s <code>mkdocs.yml</code> config file under
<code>plugings.search</code>. The <code>config</code> object was new in MkDocs version <em>1.0</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>data</code> object contains a list of document objects. Each document object is
made up of a <code>location</code> (URL), a <code>title</code>, and <code>text</code> which can be used to create
a search index and/or display search results.</p>
<p>If present, the <code>index</code> object contains a pre-built index which offers
performance improvements for larger sites. Note that the pre-built index is only
created if the user explicitly enables the <a href="../../user-guide/configuration/#prebuild_index">prebuild_index</a> config option.
Themes should expect the index to not be present, but can choose to use the
index when it is available. The <code>index</code> object was new in MkDocs version <em>1.0</em>.</p>
<h2 id="packaging-themes">Packaging Themes</h2>
<p>MkDocs makes use of <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/">Python packaging</a> to distribute themes. This comes with a
few requirements.</p>
<p>To see an example of a package containing one theme, see the <a href="https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootstrap/">MkDocs Bootstrap
theme</a> and to see a package that contains many themes, see the <a href="https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/">MkDocs
Bootswatch theme</a>.</p>
<p>!!! Note</p>
<pre><code>It is not strictly necessary to package a theme, as the entire theme
can be contained in the `custom_dir`. If you have created a "one-off theme,"
that should be sufficient. However, if you intend to distribute your theme
for others to use, packaging the theme has some advantages. By packaging
your theme, your users can more easily install it, they can rely on a default
[configuration] being defined, and they can then take advantage of the
[custom_dir] to make tweaks to your theme to better suit their needs.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="package-layout">Package Layout</h3>
<p>The following layout is recommended for themes. Two files at the top level
directory called <code>MANIFEST.in</code> and <code>setup.py</code> beside the theme directory which
contains an empty <code>__init__.py</code> file, a theme configuration file
(<code>mkdocs-theme.yml</code>), and your template and media files.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">.
|-- MANIFEST.in
|-- theme_name
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- mkdocs-theme.yml
|   |-- main.html
|   |-- styles.css
`-- setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file should contain the following contents but with
theme_name updated and any extra file extensions added to the include.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">recursive-include theme_name *.ico *.js *.css *.png *.html *.eot *.svg *.ttf *.woff
recursive-exclude * __pycache__
recursive-exclude * *.py[co]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>setup.py</code> should include the following text with the modifications
described below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from setuptools import setup, find_packages

VERSION = '0.0.1'

setup(
    name=&quot;mkdocs-themename&quot;,
    version=VERSION,
    url='',
    license='',
    description='',
    author='',
    author_email='',
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    entry_points={
        'mkdocs.themes': [
            'themename = theme_name',
        ]
    },
    zip_safe=False
)
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the URL, license, description, author and author email address.</p>
<p>The name should follow the convention <code>mkdocs-themename</code> (like <code>mkdocs-
bootstrap</code> and <code>mkdocs-bootswatch</code>), starting with MkDocs, using hyphens to
separate words and including the name of your theme.</p>
<p>Most of the rest of the file can be left unedited. The last section we need to
change is the entry_points. This is how MkDocs finds the theme(s) you are
including in the package. The name on the left is the one that users will use
in their mkdocs.yml and the one on the right is the directory containing your
theme files.</p>
<p>The directory you created at the start of this section with the main.html file
should contain all of the other theme files. The minimum requirement is that
it includes a <code>main.html</code> for the theme. It <strong>must</strong> also include a
<code>__init__.py</code> file which should be empty, this file tells Python that the
directory is a package.</p>
<h3 id="theme-configuration">Theme Configuration</h3>
<p>A packaged theme is required to include a configuration file named
<code>mkdocs_theme.yml</code> which is placed in the root of your template files. The file
should contain default configuration options for the theme. However, if the
theme offers no configuration options, the file is still required and can be
left blank. A theme which is not packaged does not need a <code>mkdocs_theme.yml</code>
file as that file is not loaded from <code>theme.custom_dir</code>.</p>
<p>The theme author is free to define any arbitrary options deemed necessary and
those options will be made available in the templates to control behavior.
For example, a theme might want to make a sidebar optional and include the
following in the <code>mkdocs_theme.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">show_sidebar: true
</code></pre>
<p>Then in a template, that config option could be referenced:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% if config.theme.show_sidebar %}
&lt;div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<p>And the user could override the default in their project&rsquo;s <code>mkdocs.yml</code> config
file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">theme:
    name: themename
    show_sidebar: false
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to arbitrary options defined by the theme, MkDocs defines a few
special options which alters its behavior:</p>
<p>!!! block &ldquo;&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>#### locale

This option mirrors the [theme] config option of the same name. If this
value is not defined in the `mkdocs_theme.yml` file and the user does not
set it in `mkdocs.yml` then it will default to `en` (English). The value
is expected to match the language used in the text provided by the theme
(such a "next" and "previous" links) and should be used as the value of
the `&lt;html&gt;` tag's `lang` attribute. See [Supporting theme localization/
translation](#supporting-theme-localizationtranslation) for more
information.

Note that during configuration validation, the provided string is converted
to a `Locale` object. The object contains `Locale.language` and
`Locale.territory` attributes and will resolve as a string from within a
template. Therefore, the following will work fine:

    &lt;html lang="{ config.theme.locale }"&gt;

If the locale was set to `fr_CA` (Canadian French), then the above template
would render as:

    &lt;html lang="fr_CA"&gt;

If you did not want the territory attribute to be included, then reference
the `language` attribute directly:

    &lt;html lang="{ config.theme.locale.language }"&gt;

That would render as:

    &lt;html lang="fr"&gt;

#### static_templates

This option mirrors the [theme] config option of the same name and allows
some defaults to be set by the theme. Note that while the user can add
templates to this list, the user cannot remove templates included in the
theme's config.

#### extends

Defines a parent theme that this theme inherits from. The value should be
the string name of the parent theme. Normal Jinja inheritance rules apply.
</code></pre>
<p>Plugins may also define some options which allow the theme to inform a plugin
about which set of plugin options it expects. See the documentation for any
plugins you may wish to support in your theme.</p>
<h3 id="distributing-themes">Distributing Themes</h3>
<p>With the above changes, your theme should now be ready to install. This can be
done with pip, using <code>pip install .</code> if you are still in the same directory as
the setup.py.</p>
<p>Most Python packages, including MkDocs, are distributed on PyPI. To do this,
you should run the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">python setup.py register
</code></pre>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an account setup, you should be prompted to create one.</p>
<p>For a much more detailed guide, see the official Python packaging
documentation for <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing/">Packaging and Distributing Projects</a>.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-theme-localizationtranslation">Supporting theme Localization/Translation</h2>
<p>While the built-in themes provide support for <a href="../../user-guide/localizing-your-theme/">localization/translation</a> of
templates, custom themes and third-party themes may choose not to. Regardless,
the <a href="#locale"><code>locale</code></a> setting of the <code>theme</code> configuration option is always
present and is relied upon by other parts of the system. Therefore, it is
recommended that all third-party themes use the same setting for designating a
language regardless of the system they use for translation. In that way, users
will experience consistent behavior regardless of the theme they may choose.</p>
<p>The method for managing translations is up to the developers of a theme.
However, if a theme developer chooses to use the same mechanisms used by the
built-in themes, the sections below outline how to enable and make use of the
same commands utilized by MkDocs.</p>
<h3 id="enabling-the-localizationtranslation-commands">Enabling the Localization/Translation commands</h3>
<p>MkDocs includes some helper commands which are light wrappers around <a href="https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/setup.html">pybabel&rsquo;s
commands</a>. To use the commands on your own theme, add the following to
your theme&rsquo;s <code>setup.py</code> script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from mkdocs.commands.setup import babel_cmdclass

setup(
    ...
    cmdclass=babel_cmdclass
)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>cmdclass=babel_cmdclass</code> was added an a parameter passed to
the <code>setup</code> function.</p>
<p>!!! warning
    As <strong>pybabel is not installed by default</strong> and most users will not have
    pybabel installed, theme developers and/or translators should make sure to
    have installed the necessary dependencies
    (using <code>pip install mkdocs[i18n]</code>) in order for the commands to be
    available for use.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-localizationtranslation-commands">Using the Localization/Translation commands</h3>
<p>Since the translation commands are embedded in the <code>setup.py</code> script of your
custom theme they should be called from the root of your theme&rsquo;s working
tree as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python setup.py &lt;command_name&gt; [OPTIONS]
</code></pre>
<p>Each command provides a detailed list of options available with the <code>-h/--help</code>
option.</p>
<p>For an overview of the workflow used by MkDocs to translate the built-in
themes, see the appropriate <a href="../../about/contributing/#submitting-changes-to-the-builtin-themes">section</a> of the Contributing Guide and the
<a href="../translations/">Translation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Default values for many of the options to the commands can be defined in a
<code>setup.cfg</code> file. Create a section using the command name as the section name,
and the long option name as the key. See MkDocs&rsquo; own <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/master/setup.cfg">setup.cfg</a> file for an
example.</p>
<p>A summary of changes/additions to the behavior and options of the upstream
<a href="https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/setup.html">pybabel commands</a> are summarized below.</p>
<h4 id="compile_catalog">compile_catalog</h4>
<p>The <code>-t/--theme</code> option has been added to this command. The <code>theme</code> specified
must be a <code>theme</code> defined as a entry point in the same <code>setup.py</code> script. Other
themes will not be recognized. If only one <code>theme</code> has been defined as an entry
point, then that <code>theme</code> will be used as the default if none is specified by
this option. If more than one <code>theme</code> is defined as entry points, then no
default is set and a <code>theme</code> must be specified by this option. The command only
operates on one theme at a time. Therefore, the command needs to be run once
for each theme included in a package.</p>
<p>When a <code>theme</code> is specified, the directory of that <code>theme</code> as defined in the
entry point is used to define a default value of the <code>-d/--directory</code> option.
The <code>--directory</code> option is set to <code>{theme_dir}/locales</code>. If a <code>directory</code> is
passed to the <code>--directory</code> option, then the <code>theme</code> option is ignored.</p>
<h4 id="extract_messages">extract_messages</h4>
<p>The <code>-t/--theme</code> option has been added to this command. The <code>theme</code> specified
must be a <code>theme</code> defined as a entry point in the same <code>setup.py</code> script. Other
themes will not be recognized. If only one <code>theme</code> has been defined as an entry
point, then that <code>theme</code> will be used as the default if none is specified by
this option. If more than one <code>theme</code> is defined as entry points, then no
default is set and a <code>theme</code> must be specified by this option. The command only
operates on one theme at a time. Therefore, the command needs to be run once
for each theme included in a package.</p>
<p>When a <code>theme</code> is specified, the directory of that <code>theme</code> as defined in the
entry point is used to define a default value for the <code>--input-dirs</code> and
<code>--output-file</code> options. The <code>--input-dirs</code> option is set to the <code>theme</code>
directory and <code>--output-file</code> is set to <code>{theme_dir}/{domain}.pot</code>. If a path
is provided to either option, then the <code>theme</code> option is ignored for that
option.</p>
<p>The <code>--domain</code> option has been added to this command and can be used to
override the <code>domain</code> used for the <code>output-file</code> based on the <code>theme</code>.
Defaults to <code>messages</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>-F/--mapping-file</code> option defaults to the <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs/themes/babel.cfg">mapping file</a> used by MkDocs&rsquo;
built-in themes. However, if that mapping file does not meet your theme&rsquo;s needs
to can override it by providing your own and passing the path of that file into
the option.</p>
<h4 id="init_catalog">init_catalog</h4>
<p>The <code>-t/--theme</code> option has been added to this command. The <code>theme</code> specified
must be a <code>theme</code> defined as a entry point in the same <code>setup.py</code> script. Other
themes will not be recognized. If only one <code>theme</code> has been defined as an entry
point, then that <code>theme</code> will be used as the default if none is specified by
this option. If more than one <code>theme</code> is defined as entry points, then no
default is set and a <code>theme</code> must be specified by this option. The command only
operates on one theme at a time. Therefore, the command needs to be run once
for each theme included in a package.</p>
<p>When a <code>theme</code> is specified, the directory of that <code>theme</code> as defined in the
entry point is used to define a default value for the <code>-i/--input-file</code> and
<code>-d/--output-dir</code> options. The <code>--input-file</code> option is set to
<code>{theme_dir}/{domain}.pot</code> (<code>domain</code> defaults to <code>messages</code>) and <code>--output-dir</code>
is set to <code>{theme_dir}/locales</code>. If a path is provided to either option, then
the <code>theme</code> option is ignored for that option.</p>
<h4 id="update_catalog">update_catalog</h4>
<p>The <code>-t/--theme</code> option has been added to this command. The <code>theme</code> specified
must be a <code>theme</code> defined as a entry point in the same <code>setup.py</code> script. Other
themes will not be recognized. If only one <code>theme</code> has been defined as an entry
point, then that <code>theme</code> will be used as the default if none is specified by
this option. If more than one <code>theme</code> is defined as entry points, then no
default is set and a <code>theme</code> must be specified by this option. The command only
operates on one theme at a time. Therefore, the command needs to be run once
for each theme included in a package.</p>
<p>When a <code>theme</code> is specified, the directory of that <code>theme</code> as defined in the
entry point is used to define a default value for the <code>-i/--input-file</code> and
<code>-d/--output-dir</code> options. The <code>--input-file</code> option is set to
<code>{theme_dir}/{domain}.pot</code> (<code>domain</code> defaults to <code>messages</code>) and <code>--output-dir</code>
is set to <code>{theme_dir}/locales</code>. If a path is provided to either option, then
the <code>theme</code> option is ignored for that option.</p>
<h3 id="example-custom-theme-localizationtranslation-workflow">Example custom theme Localization/Translation workflow</h3>
<p>!!! note</p>
<pre><code>If your theme inherits from an existing theme which already provides
translation catalogs, your theme's translations will be merged with the
parent theme's translations during a MkDocs build.

This means that you only need to concentrate on the added translations.
Yet, you will still benefit from the translations of the parent theme. At
the same time, you may override any of parent theme's translations!

<h3 id="packaging-translations-with-your-theme">Packaging Translations with your theme</h3>
<p>While the Portable Object Template (<code>pot</code>) file created by the
<code>extract_messages</code> command and the Portable Object (<code>po</code>) files created by the
<code>init_catalog</code> and <code>update_catalog</code> commands are useful for creating and
editing translations, they are not used by MkDocs directly and do not need to
be included in a packaged release of a theme. When MkDocs builds a site with
translations, it only makes use of the binary <code>mo</code> files(s) for the specified
locale. Therefore, when <a href="#packaging-themes">packaging a theme</a>, you would need to make the
following addition to your <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">recursive-include theme_name *.mo
</code></pre>
<p>Then, before building your Python package, you will want to ensure that the
binary <code>mo</code> file for each locale is up-to-date by running the <code>compile_catalog</code>
command for each locale. MkDocs expects the binary <code>mo</code> files to be located at
<code>locales/&lt;locale&gt;/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo</code>, which the <code>compile_catalog</code>
command automatically does for you. See <a href="../translations/#testing-theme-translations">Testing theme translations</a> for
details.</p>
<p>!!! note</p>
<pre><code>As outlined in our [Translation Guide], the MkDocs project has chosen to
include the `pot` and `po` files in our code repository, but not the
`mo` files. This requires us to always run `compile_catalog` before
packaging a new release regardless of whether any changes were made to a
translation or not. However, you may chose an alternate workflow for your
theme. At a minimum, you need to ensure that up-to-date `mo` files are
included at the correct location in each release. However, you may use a
different process for generating those `mo` files if you chose to do so.
